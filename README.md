Description: This VBA macro, named CropAllImagesOnActiveSheet, is designed to run within Microsoft Excel. Its purpose is to
automatically crop all images present on the active worksheet. The macro iterates through each shape on the active sheet, 
checking if it's an image (msoPicture). If it identifies an image, it applies specific cropping values to adjust the image's appearance. Adjustments include cropping from the left, top, right, 
and bottom sides of the image, as specified in the comments within the code. Users can customize these cropping values to suit their specific requirements.
